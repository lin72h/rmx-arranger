# testing-dtrace — DTrace-first observability ("observe, don't perturb")

- tier: **shared baseline** (all roles)
- state: **ACTIVE** (adopted 2026-06-22)
- index: [testing.md](testing.md). Verify file:line and guest capability before acting.

## The rule

**Prefer DTrace (FreeBSD's tracing infrastructure) over hand-added `printf`/`dprintf`
instrumentation for diagnosing runtime behavior.** Do not commit ad-hoc debug prints into
product source. Observation should not require editing — least of all editing the code under
investigation.

## Why (verified, from op-093)

The op-093 `dispatch_after` debugging used hand-added `dprintf(2, "OP093_T …")` lines in
`lib/libdispatch/src/source.c`. That approach is costly, and in this case actively
counterproductive:

1. **It reinvents probes that already exist.** libdispatch ships a DTrace USDT provider —
   `lib/libdispatch/src/provider.d` defines the `dispatch` provider with `queue-push`/`-pop`,
   `callout-entry`/`-return`, and **timer probes** (`DISPATCH_TIMER_CONFIGURE`,
   `DISPATCH_TIMER_PROGRAM`, timer-fire), wired via `trace.h`'s `_dispatch_trace_timer_*`
   behind `DISPATCH_USE_DTRACE`. The WIP `dprintf` at `_dispatch_timers_run2` sits one line
   from the existing `_dispatch_trace_timer_fire` probe.
2. **Recompile + redeploy per iteration** — the slow loop ("hours").
3. **Must be stripped before commit** — diff pollution + risk of shipping debug code.
4. **Heisenberg on timing bugs.** `dprintf(2,…)` is a synchronous, lock-taking write to fd 2;
   for a timing/race bug (op-093 is a manager-bootstrap race) it can mask or shift the very
   race being chased. DTrace probe overhead is far lower and less perturbing.
5. **It edits the core to observe it** — the opposite of the Mach-IPC RESTRICTED doctrine
   ("don't touch the foundation"). DTrace is observation-only: zero product change, no approval
   gate tripped, and it lets us inspect the timer/IPC core *without editing it*.

## Tooling, in order of preference

1. **Built-in USDT** — build the DTrace/introspection variant (`-DDISPATCH_USE_DTRACE=1`); the
   semantic `dispatch:::timer-*` / `queue-*` / `callout-*` probes light up with no source
   edits. Use first when a subsystem already defines a provider (libdispatch does).
2. **`pid` provider** — ad-hoc function entry/return/args/timestamps on any function
   (`_dispatch_source_set_timer2`, `_dispatch_kq_update`, `_dispatch_mgr_timer_timeout_fire`)
   with **no recompile and no source edit**. The default for "where does control actually go".
3. **Kernel probes** — `syscall::kevent*`, `fbt::*kqueue*`/timer/callout. Correlate userland
   arming with kernel submission + fire in **one script** to settle boundary questions
   definitively — e.g. op-093's open (a) *never-submitted* vs (b) *submitted-but-not-processed*.

## Precondition — verify, don't assume

DTrace needs kernel support in the **rmxOS guest**:
- `options KDTRACE_HOOKS` (+ `KDTRACE_FRAME` for `fbt` stack walks) compiled into the test
  kernel; `kldload dtraceall` succeeds; userland `pid`/USDT also need the framework loaded.
- The custom Mach kernel may not be built with DTrace hooks — **check on the guest before
  mandating a DTrace-based op**. If absent: enable it in the test kernel, or fall back to
  USDT-only / a single targeted print for that one case.

## Legitimate exceptions (when a print is still right)

- Very-early bring-up paths that run **before** the dtrace framework is up.
- Kernel paths before DTrace init.
- A value no probe exposes, where a one-off print is genuinely cheaper than a custom USDT
  probe — but then add a *real* USDT probe if it'll be needed again, don't leave the print.

In all cases: a debug print is **throwaway** — it never lands in a committed artifact.

## Immediate application (op-093)

Build `DISPATCH_USE_DTRACE=1`; use the existing `dispatch:::timer-*` probes + a `pid`/kernel
script to pin (a)/(b); **remove the `OP093_T` dprintfs entirely** rather than stripping them
later — contingent on the guest KDTRACE_HOOKS check above.
